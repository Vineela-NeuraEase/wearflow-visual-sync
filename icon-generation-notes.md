# PWA Icon Generation Notes

After initializing the Capacitor project, generate all required icons for PWA, iOS, and Android:

```bash
# Install Capacitor Assets for icon generation
npm install @capacitor/assets

# Run the asset generation command
npx @capacitor/assets generate

# This will create all the necessary icons based on a source icon
# Remember to create a 1024x1024 icon.png file in the root directory first

# Alternatively, you can manually create icons for different platforms:
# For PWA: 
# - 192x192, 512x512, and maskable icons (with safe zone)
# For iOS:
# - Various sizes from 20x20 to 1024x1024
# For Android:
# - Various sizes for different densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
```
